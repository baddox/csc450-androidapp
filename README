This is a vanilla Android project. Since I don't know how an eclipse project
is generated I have created a vanilla project with a .gitignore. As you see
files that are not needed to keep track of (compiles or build junk) simply
add a regex to ignore them. Happy ignoring!


Notes:
To open the exisitng project with Eclipse do:
Use File > Import and select General > Existing Projects into Workspace. Click next and then browse to the directory contain the project directory. 

Eclipse will probably give you an error when you first try to compile. If so simple create
a folder name gen in eclipse. It will then populate the needed files ande what not.
